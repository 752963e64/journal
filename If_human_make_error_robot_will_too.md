# If human make errors, robot will too. :D

It's your fault! the intrinsic faulty personage you are. :)

Let's be clearer, It's still your fault when robot making errors... WHY are you enhancing your error pool like this? :)

Is it another intrinsic feature. :D

## the acceptable, the fatal errors

Imagine making AI were a fatal error... But don't worry, in a primal world It takes time to assume error lvl if there is...

The cigarettes the cancer is a nice example. :D
