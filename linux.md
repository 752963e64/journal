# Linux!

It's been a while I'm daily driving linux and these days everything is running very well!

20 years ago it started with **back|track2** passing by **debian/ubuntu** **gentoo** **linuxfromscratch** to **alpinelinux**

## I wanna write a book...

A book that free readers from the wrapping era...

That explain the keyz from computer independance in a world of distributed software.

A book that lead you to comprehend and feel comfortable with all the useful software distributions that I know.

Free software is independance in essence of things, but it's not true everywhere(must be aware).

# The unknown is what you don't know.
