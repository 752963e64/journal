# How it ffeeeels?

My country (france) with europa... is playing a game that cannot end in peace...

trying to fatigue russia in all corners make us enemies...

If russia decides to fight against those helping ukrainia, there will be no troopers. Because in this strategy everything blow up at same time.

I'm quietly laughing listening at our medias saying that one day russia is gonna fight directly...

I want to SAY... "WHY damn it? dumbasses that you are... in a fragil crew feeling safe you tried to kill them!"

russia Is the only country in the world that can setup the hell on earth!

## The chip commanded wars

I've plenty ideaz based on what I see through my discoveries on the wargame... almost everything is outdated...

The need to redo it all is well present to participate the festival... manned armored vehicules pilots are as vulnerable the infantry...

The increase effect from unmanned vehicules will lead to long distance attacks that will of course end in a thermo nuclear war...

Close combat will be handled by ground and air machines that aim and shout 10000x faster than any trained soldier...

Some facts needs to be taken anyway despite all of that... Some countries possesses some strange automatism if anything wrong happens that shows none of these countries will accept to loose 😸...

But how things goes it can only happen a day... **Fallout** is near.

The basis this dying democracy is based on mafia rules... "Your ability to bomb others"... But You must defend your interests if you can anyway...

It is really an **ape planet** that play division equation since the beginning of time... They eat ppl faster than wild!

# Breaking news!

Ukrainia attacked Poutin's home! 😸 like Trump said... "It's not the right time to do it..." I think in the next days we will see the most beautiful fireworks ever seen in the world!

# The present days...

The ongoing war works such way from the russian POV advancing thru ukrainia...

- air control 8 or 12 rotors(that stick in the air very long time... long distance radio system, fail safe. high altitude capable. High quality camera. can carry literally everything following weight limit, it can also drop nades)

- shelling with BM-21 and lately another one firing bigger pencil(that decimate entire building with just one ogive)...

- drone kamikaz(usual racing drone... with RPG ovive and an home made assembly of coil that seem to init the ogive at contact)

- infantry(ak47, ak101, RPG, dragunov, some strange looking heavy weapon that fire rounds tale as your hand and wide as your thumb)

- armored vehicle(mostly tank)

Ukrainian soldiers did trenches and ground caves as stronghold alike they were at WW1&2... You don't fight such strategy with trenches... They learned (The world too...)

Each building office, house, cave even suspicious bush... is checked and decimated if there is ukrainian soldiers... The landscape is literally post apocalyptic!

The amount of mercenaries that went to ukrainia to fight russia because they needed action in their life and found death is increasing everyday...

You can find bodies of ukrainian soldiers entirely flat on roads because vehicles drove on dead bodies... It's the hell on earth.

Russia's culture do not permit any offense... you are already lost if such thing happen.

## It's not a glory to

It's my understanding... Lately I determined in a movie storytelling a truth that russia had literally sold armored vehicles, weapons/ammo, BM-21 to bin laden army...

# Jesus Christ® what a mess 😸
