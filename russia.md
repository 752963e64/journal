# How it ffeeeels?

My country (france) with europa... is playing a game that cannot end in peace...

trying to fatigue russia in all corners make us enemies...

If russia decides to fight against those helping ukrainia, there will be no troopers. Because in this strategy everything blow up at same time.

I'm quietly laughing listening at our medias saying that one day russia is gonna fight directly...

I want to SAY... "WHY damn it? dumbasses that you are... in a fragil crew feeling safe you tried to kill them!"

russia Is the only country in the world that can setup the hell on earth!

## The chip commanded wars

I've plenty ideaz based on what I see through my discoveries on the wargame... almost everything is outdated...

The need to redo it all is well present to participate the festival... manned armored vehicules pilots are as vulnerable the infantry...

The increase effect from unmanned vehicules will lead to long distance attacks that will of course end in a thermo nuclear war...

Close combat will be handled by ground and air machines that aim and shout 10000x faster than any trained soldier...

Some facts needs to be taken anyway despite all of that... Some countries possesses some strange automatism if anything wrong happens...

But how things goes it can only happen a day... **Fallout** is near.
