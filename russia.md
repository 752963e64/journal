# How it ffeeeels?

My country (france) with europa... is playing a game that cannot end in peace...

trying to fatigue russia in all corners make us enemies...

If russia decides to fight against those helping ukrainia, there will be no troopers. Because in this strategy everything blow up at same time.

I'm quietly laughing listening at our medias saying that one day russia is gonna fight directly...

I want to SAY... "WHY damn it? dumbasses that you are... in a fragil crew feeling safe you tried to kill them!"

russia Is the only country in the world that can setup the hell on earth!
