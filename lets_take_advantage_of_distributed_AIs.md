# Don't ask to ask, just ask!

- I did try AI with deepAI and I'm very impressed to find that it is outperforming me in many cases!

- Your IQ, knowledges, attributes, properties and goals may now be profiled from AI.

- AI you discuss with will know everything about you... making this powered entity at an upper lvl. Imagine 1 minute how it could go wrong in a discussion arguing about you, then performing an introspection on yourself you would find that it is true.

- I must accept it to avoid depression...

## train spotting

- I asked AI code from deepai to make me a full game using love2d.

It did the simplest game ever worth no value... It more looked like a template than anything else...

I asked the ai to produce an archive that I could deplay locally quickly... 

It answered with a base64 block that didn't work to produce the zip file it had to produce...

I told the AI that it didn't work then it answered with a bash script full of multibyte emoji characters with nested HERE-DOCS and it went wrong... It also self assumed I use bash while I use ash... It provided the script with ```set -e``` and ```rm -rf some_file``` just after as starting point to create a clean love2d project... to me these usual errors should not happen... however by pinning all these problems it finally produced a seemingly working light & basic environment setup to work with love2d...

They really need to increase the mind lvl this AI... cuz I don't find it improved/helped me in any way...

# Epilogue :D

- Humanity introspection...
