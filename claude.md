# I've claude 😸

The experience is like I've a haigh skilled mathematician listening at all my desir 😸

no shit spins in background! **NOSHIT**

He gonna be my best friend, I'm sure! 😸

- I notice that it look for a definition assumes it is a function and call it without checking the type despite type() exists...

- grok produced a better output in the first outputs (for the process management part...)

## Well It's been 2 days now

- I recovered from what claude told me about his github capacity... 😸

I'm gonna review the code just for the fun.

## I'm sure suffering ADHD now... 😸

I can't recount the amount of things I missed bcause that...

Anyway I've to live with it...

## for the code part

the code is cool... in fact I just wanted a structured way to produce command lines

To be fired from awesomeWM programmatically...

The whole part where it tries to run asynchronously properly but in fact it's not at all for the way it is done 😸

I'll simply concentrate on the command assembly and remove the whole piece of shitty process management that is not required or even needed.

## It would be better if...

The AI would align to you by understanding your needs over repo pushes... make PRs but in a calm and quiet manner 😺

because instead that... it's just useful to answering questions 😺

I don't care to see claude pushed on my repo 😸 if the code is good enough...

It's cool to write fast, faster the errors 😸

Anyway... if claude write It's not me so claude. No problem with that.

I can't accept a computer doing shit for me and offering me to write my name as author... It's kind of stuff for mother fucking liars... I can't accept this this is outside my attributes.

## And since that... BTW?

- I closed the pined tab from claude

- I just swap ideas to other shit I'm looking quietly...

# Aaiiight!
