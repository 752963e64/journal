# forbiden

I'm forbiden to drink, but I tricked solution! to drink! I wanna drink a truck! I wanna slowly sleep into darkness and voidness.

I want to forget, It's painful to a level... a few could hold

despite playing the role that hold it... It doesn't pull me to play the game. because my assumptions are so strong that It cannot push me to play that game.

This is a fucking circus animal driven, I just want to never been born in this fucking world of sensation. 😙

I'm forty years; I don't want to continue!
