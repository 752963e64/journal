# A reminder to myself and maybe you 😸

few years ago someone in the circle of familly that own a flourishing enterprise asked me to make a website, no 3.

SO I took a bootstrap found resources and crafted the 3 websites... he wanted me to advertise the sites but I never done that and I never learned about...

So I did look around google... what I discovered by loging into google space... were that google had made an entire framework to manage presence on internet including all the damn tools to do literally everything!

You can't versus such resources... I was literally ashamed myself to be offering 50% what google could... so I did offer the person to try google himself...

## nowaday... It's worst 😅

They collect all data freely and resell it as it's a legit thing that comes from their scrapping game...

They **wrecked** the work of many ppl

now ppl are short windowed... the only things they know is how to ask the machine...

# The smashing machine
