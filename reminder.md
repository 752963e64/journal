# A reminder to myself and maybe you 😸

few years ago someone in the circle of familly that own a flourishing enterprise asked me to make a website, no 3.

SO I took a bootstrap found resources and crafted the 3 websites... he wanted me to advertise the sites but I never done that and I never learned about...

So I did look around google... what I discovered by loging into google space... were that google had made an entire framework to manage presence on internet including all the damn tools to do literally everything!

You can't versus such resources... I was literally ashamed myself to be offering 50% what google could... so I did offer the person to try google himself...

I Imagine the amount of money they can do with what I saw!... It's disgusting really... It's like they planned the entire planet is gonna link to google. letting not a fucking chance to any competition.

## nowaday... It's worst 😅

Some ppl collect all data freely and resell it as it's a legit thing that comes from their scrapping game...

appearently sharing the same base... a software that seems to think...

They **wrecked** the work of many ppl and they continue!

now ppl are short windowed... the only things they know is how to ask the machine...

## A peak in the bandwidth

- Isn't the fan base audience... It is the discovery audience.

- You can usually expected 5% from the discovery audience to become a fan base audience persisting in time...

- It's nah much really... but it helps you thinking you are util. 😸
