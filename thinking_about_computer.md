# thinking about computer

I almost done a mistake looking to upgrade my computer...

Buying 95W tdp processor that consume +250W full load... This is clearly missing synapses in 2025... Or you running a solar powerplant and everything is fine... advantages? your processor is warming up room at 95W TDP :D

I must accept I've to change! I found full board 3ghz 8 cores 16GB ram that consumes 30W full load! This is way less than what I have now IDLE! I hope I wont struggle to get graphic drivers working... I'm informing myself nah worries.

# What is intellingence

Buying a new Intel board That do the JOB!

## to palliate some limitation(s)

I bought some ram 4gb were a bit too few so I did double to 8GB my old quad core is very happy 😸

I bought an ssd from ali that came with an HPFS filesystem ready to use... that was funny... I zeroed it then installed on the laptop... laptop is very happy 😸

now I project to increase ram to 16GB on the laptop... I just need grab some information on how they powered 😸

but really I'm no sure I need 16GB... my desktop consumes around ~400mb ram, everything is fast well maybe 8GB why not...

I'm about to repair the battery from laptop. I just need prepare 4 cells and solder them toghether...

need buy a new stock keyboard for the laptop.

Remember the laptop is alita. I brought it back to life. 🙂

# Update (brown out)

I burned pdb from laptop battery awhile reassembling it... it's dead for life...

I ordered 2x8GB anyway no other solution it's my only pc with a decent gpu 

I need buy a new PC... very slim very portable very tiny very lightweigh powerful enough qwerty that I can carry and use on my leg comfortably

I'm falling in love with that HP machine! it works nice with few tweak needed... The SSD changed everything 😸 and soon 16GB memory! 10 $ per ram. cheap 😙

It's broken at half no stock keyboard, half opened... it is gonna sleep aside me I'm too much attached anyway. (I've no choice) 😸

# Update (new toy available)

I defibrilated an optilex3020m that were lying around since years... Low consumption 35W

some stuffs required to make it a good challenger 2x8GB DDR3 1600Mhz, a new SSD, and a Xeon E3L 4cores, 8threads (45W) (Haswell GT1)

The motherboard series marking is somewhat DROLE **DOGFISH** lolz

This machine impress me... only 2 pentium cores(G3240T) and perform better than my quad core, does less noise... it was there aside me since years...

I did update the bios for security®, It's gonna be my new main cyberdeck... The quad core is near service ending, I'm tired to hear that fan blowing 😸

# Soon®
