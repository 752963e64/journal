# thinking about computer

I almost done a mistake looking to upgrade my computer...

Buying 95W tdp processor that consume +250W full load... This is clearly missing synapses in 2025... Or you running a solar powerplant and everything is fine... advantages? your processor is warming up room at 95W TDP :D

I must accept I've to change! I found full board 3ghz 8 cores 16GB ram that consumes 30W full load! This is way less than what I have now IDLE! I hope I wont struggle to get graphic drivers working... I'm informing myself nah worries.

# What is intellingence

Buying a new Intel board That do the JOB!

## to palliate some limitation(s)

I bought some ram 4gb were a bit too few so I did double to 8GB my old quad core is very happy 😸

I bought an ssd from ali that came with an HPFS filesystem ready to use... that was funny... I zeroed it then installed on the laptop... laptop is very happy 😸

now I project to increase ram to 16GB on the laptop... I just need grab some information on how they powered 😸

but really I'm no sure I need 16GB... my desktop consumes around ~400mb ram, everything is fast well maybe 8GB why not...

I'm about to repair the battery from laptop. I just need prepare 4 cells and solder them toghether...

need buy a new stock keyboard for the laptop.

Remember the laptop is alita. I brought it back to life. 🙂
