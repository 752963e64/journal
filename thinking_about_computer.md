# thinking about computer

I almost done a mistake looking to upgrade my computer...

Buying 95W tdp processor that consume +250W full load... This is clearly missing synapses in 2025... Or you running a solar powerplant and everything is fine... your processor is warming up room at 95W TDP :D

I must accept I've to change! I found full board 3ghz 8 cores 16GB ram that consumes 30W full load! This is way less than what I have now IDLE! I hope I wont struggle to get graphic drivers working... I'm informing myself nah worries.
