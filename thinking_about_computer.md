# thinking about computer

I almost done a mistake looking to upgrade my computer...

Buying 95W tdp processor that consume +250W full load... This is clearly missing synapses in 2025... Or you running a solar powerplant and everything is fine... advantages? your processor is warming up room at 95W TDP :D

I must accept I've to change! I found full board 3ghz 8 cores 16GB ram that consumes 30W full load! This is way less than what I have now IDLE! I hope I wont struggle to get graphic drivers working... I'm informing myself nah worries.

# What is intellingence

Buying a new Intel board That do the JOB!

## to palliate some limitation(s)

I bought some ram 4gb were a bit too few so I did double to 8GB my old quad core is very happy 😸

I bought an ssd from ali that came with an HPFS filesystem ready to use... that was funny... I zeroed it then installed on the laptop... laptop is very happy 😸

now I project to increase ram to 16GB on the laptop... I just need grab some information on how they powered 😸

but really I'm no sure I need 16GB... my desktop consumes around ~400mb ram, everything is fast well maybe 8GB why not...

I'm about to repair the battery from laptop. I just need prepare 4 cells and solder them toghether...

need buy a new stock keyboard for the laptop.

Remember the laptop is alita. I brought it back to life. 🙂

# Update (brown out)

I burned pdb from laptop battery awhile reassembling it... it's dead for life...

I ordered 2x8GB anyway no other solution it's my only pc with a decent gpu 

I need buy a new PC... very slim very portable very tiny very lightweigh powerful enough qwerty that I can carry and use on my leg comfortably

I'm falling in love with that HP machine! it works nice with few tweak needed... The SSD changed everything 😸 and soon 16GB memory! 10 $ per ram. cheap 😙

It's broken at half no stock keyboard, half opened... it is gonna sleep aside me I'm too much attached anyway. (I've no choice) 😸

# Update (new toy available)

I defibrilated an optilex3020m that were lying around since years... Low consumption 35W

some stuffs required to make it a good challenger 2x8GB DDR3 1600Mhz, a new SSD, and a Xeon E3L 4cores, 8threads (45W) (Haswell GT1)

The motherboard series marking is somewhat DROLE **DOGFISH** lolz

This machine impress me... only 2 pentium cores(G3240T) and perform better than my quad core, does less noise... it was there aside me since years...

I did update the bios for security®, It's gonna be my new main cyberdeck... The quad core is near service ending, I'm tired to hear that fan blowing 😸

# Soon®

# Experimenting makes me an expert.

SINGLE CHANNEL MEMORY in use!!! oh shit:D

# begging makes me a beggar

I was obliged to beg for my SODIMM delivery! had no feed I was about to order again but twice the actual price! fuuuuuuuuuuuu I almost wasted some precious... 😸

Payment passed today just after I did reclaim update on order! so it's 16GB 25€ fucking nice 😸

The hell... order canceled by the seller 😄... Ordered new ones! 

# Now I'm proud owner

Of a disemboweled ugly PC Machine with 16gigs of ram! 😸

I still didn't use the computer really outside booting it... I remain on my lovely old PC tower sadly...

# my first physical riscv (MCU?)

I bought a little rsicv device with a oled mini screen! in a rush to bring me back to life. I'm awaiting to receive the toy.

Yes I'm fatigued dead.

[Rich documentation at first sight... 😸](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2350-LCD-1.47-A)

I'm excited to receive it. I thought of already some kind of cosmetic it could be... However it's not that fast... it use an 1.1 usb interface making mass storage with some SDCARD would be a pain... So I guess it will be more useful looping clipping the endless circle as always highlighting some passed data 😄

a game console 😺 with keyboard as joypad! or even joystick device why not :accessibility: with the esp32 model it can play over network, sync over a main server. 😙

I've no patience! I need tools(or not)!!! Is an rp2350 emulator with a emulated screen as we can find with qemu? I think it's economically a wrong question... but let's be less wrong.

So I determined the header archive including oled driver through an user interface 😙 I noticed few dayz ago while surfing some riscv lib exists... it certainly not offering a window as a screen device... or maybe, maybe I need to bring it. **zZZZZZZzzz**

I imagine quick a textual donjon crawler multiplayer(you may meet a player or more) many text input and output llm style, dithered images, sequences of dithered images 😙

Or something more interactif with an immersive world rendered and a protagonist to drive thru the world of things.

awhile I wrote; I peeled a little more the apple innerly; I determined I don't even need to emulate the MCU to get a first impression in a window.

I thought of another application. GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR 😄. made from ESP32. The context is the world is made of divized ppl arming themselve because they all want what they doesn't belong. You live in base... you build it... you send reco squads to find new territory and then you decide if you make war (you send some green plastik mens) 😄

A desert strike remake!

I've an MPU wandering around, I can make game where you simply move/orientate the device in direction as moving input, awesome 😙

Can someone give me 100k to motivate the machine. pure mechanism pornography 😄

### don't hesitate to read the documentation there is limiattions 😸

```
These libraries (pico_xxx) provide higher-level APIs, concepts and abstractions that are common to most RP-series
microcontroller-based applications. The APIs are listed in High Level APIs. These may be libraries that have cross-
cutting concerns between multiple pieces of hardware (for example the sleep_ functions in pico_time need to concern
themselves both with the RP-series microcontrollers' timer hardware and with how processors enter and exit low power
states), or they may be pure software infrastructure required for your program to run smoothly. This includes libraries
for things like:
• Alarms, timers and time functions
• Multi-core support and synchronization primitives
• Utility functions and data structures
These libraries are generally built upon one or more underlying hardware_ libraries, and often depend on each other.
NOTE
More libraries are added over time. Certain additional libraries that are not fully supported/stable/documented (e.g. -
Audio support (via PIO), DPI/VGA/MIPI Video support (via PIO), file system support, SDIO support via (PIO)) are
included in the Pico Extras GitHub repository
```

The clock handling is pretty drole... making MCU half friendly interfaced, it's not that hard to make a monothonic clock from a clock? 😄

I'm so excited to receive it. 😄

It's BIG, I'm BIG literaly no kidding I don't need AI. with AI I'll certainly sending ten thousands more, if it can answer me... sure thing. ;D
