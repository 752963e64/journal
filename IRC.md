# IRC the IDLE activities 😸

Well IRC... I myself fallen sick from standing too much with unknown & strange ppl 😸

IRC is obviously a blockchain of latent sicknesses 🙂

You don't need it while it needs you... actually you'll understand this too late.

I want to note here that with computer I developped bad habits... like not sleeping correctly...

This has played a lot rendering me sick...

I know that some healthy ppl have no problem with IRC so it's maybe all my fault in fact 🙂
