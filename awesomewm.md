# AwesomeWM

## The making of AwesomeWM Xwindow grabber

```sh
# goals are to integrate tools to record fullscreen or a limited area of the screen.
```

### awful.screenshot

An interesting structure that hides snipping tool and everything needed to record a single image from the screen!

### ffmpeg the great!

From there I'll need to use the snipping tool, produce input feedbacks...

## my brain is painful

Do I separate snipping tool to make it modular? instead pushing forcefully and savagely my additions into awful/screenshot

that I want to rename awful/screenrecord

## I did cp screenshot.lua to screenrecord.lua

but really by reading it... I had reason... why no splitting the mousegrabbing feature to permit other thingies profits from it?

quiet hacking 😸

## to make good software

you need to split the problem in tinier problems, more problem to resolv but one goal really. 😸

## after total code impregnation

I'm not an AI... I'm not paid to make it real... so no need to hurry up 😙

Gonna end legendary modern module anyway! modern because it's not backward compatible 😸

## object pattern

Isn't an interface to a single use, the object pattern is more like a conscise structure that handles an object multiple times with the same properties, attributes! 😺

Okay? okaaayy

## this language never stop to impress me

you can ```client = c``` which ```c``` is undefined... wait there is obscure module instanciation too... over engineered for none reason is how it feels 😸

I call a variable seemingly... it's in fact a function automaticaly walked through the spagethi... It's powerful to make me loose time and compute cycles 😸

## The ongoing scripting reverse

Is going well, close to compute goal like really 😸

however I'm sure the AI would have performed all I do way quicker! 😸

## defined 

- module is made to stand in the sys tray with a camera icon

- it has a pop up menu with 3 options "record screen", "record area", "record window"

- each option take a screenshot in memory before starting to record (to decorate futur feedback)

- it record and produce record-session.[avi,mp4,mkv,webm] in the user directory.

## The more I read this module

The more I feel used... because it tells me I'm not regarding enouf what I use everyday...

The module a single object... instanciated one times 😸 reload its entire default at all turn! but why? to free one image into a memory? that's a lil too much to me...

## anyway

from 1k+ lines to ~400 currently I can see the ones and zeroz in between the lines 😸.

#### fallen asleep for around 8-10 hours 😸

taking breakfast and I'll be up back on that 🧮

## desktop mouse selection module scrapped 😸

The mouse selection module draws a dynamic box frame and return the selection geometry from the display point of view.

luckily the remaining needed mouse features are built in to awesome... just need to know where to look... 😸

need make repo... I didn't track the dissection ◾

## now I need to make the menu

and wire up features together 😸

## Now It works nice, but...

You know! you start something and you want another things 😸

really I should release it, cuz it just work and can be easily extended 😸

need push the code into a git... seems like it all becomes hard to perform when you know the reward is reality versus expectation 😙

## I feel like a rubber tire

 Used 😸

# Reason is getting me...
