## The making of AwesomeWM Xwindow grabber

```sh
# goals are to integrate tools to record fullscreen or a limited area of the screen.
```

### awful.screenshot

An interesting structure that hides snipping tool and everything needed to record a single image from the screen!

### ffmpeg the great!

From there I'll need to use the snipping tool, produce input feedbacks...

## my brain is painful

Do I separate snipping tool to make it modular? instead pushing forcefully and savagely my additions into awful/screenshot

that I want to rename awful/screenrecord

## I did cp screenshot.lua to screenrecord.lua

but really by reading it... I had reason... why no splitting the mousegrabbing feature to permit other thingies profits from it?

quiet hacking 😸

# Reason is getting me...
