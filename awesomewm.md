# AwesomeWM

## The making of AwesomeWM Xwindow grabber

```sh
# goals are to integrate tools to record fullscreen or a limited area of the screen.
```

### awful.screenshot

An interesting structure that hides snipping tool and everything needed to record a single image from the screen!

### ffmpeg the great!

From there I'll need to use the snipping tool, produce input feedbacks...

## my brain is painful

Do I separate snipping tool to make it modular? instead pushing forcefully and savagely my additions into awful/screenshot

that I want to rename awful/screenrecord

## I did cp screenshot.lua to screenrecord.lua

but really by reading it... I had reason... why no splitting the mousegrabbing feature to permit other thingies profits from it?

quiet hacking 😸

## to make good software

you need to split the problem in tinier problems, more problem to resolv but one goal really. 😸

## after total code impregnation

I'm not an AI... I'm not paid to make it real... so no need to hurry up 😙

Gonna end legendary modern module anyway! modern because it's not backward compatible 😸

## object pattern

Isn't an interface to a single use, the object pattern is more like a conscise structure that handles an object multiple times with the same properties, attributes! 😺

Okay? okaaayy

## this language never stop to impress me

you can ```client = c``` which ```c``` is undefined... wait there is obscure module instanciation too... over engineered for none reason is how it feels 😸

I call a variable seemingly... it's in fact a function automaticaly walked through the spagethi... It's powerful to make me loose time and compute cycles 😸

## The ongoing scripting reverse

Is going well, close to compute goal like really 😸

however I'm sure the AI would have performed all I do way quicker! 😸

## defined 

- module is made to stand in the sys tray with a camera icon

- it has a pop up menu with 3 options "record screen", "record area", "record window"

- each option take a screenshot in memory before starting to record (to decorate futur feedback)

- it record and produce record-session.[avi,mp4,mkv,webm] in the user directory.

## I feel like a rubber tire

 Used 😸

# Reason is getting me...
