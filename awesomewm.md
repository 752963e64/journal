# AwesomeWM

- lib version bumped today! my environment is no more working... :D
```sh
appearently there is a new way to work with metatable... boring shit 3 modules need care... 
```

## fix 😸

```sh
- no more use of module("")
- _M table vanished...
- setmetatable as return value instanciate module access
```
- It is effectively less code for the same result 👍

# Happyness is getting me...
