# EFI boot system is 100% crappy!

- I can't have my own disk strategy to work, it fucking doesn't boot anymore despite uuid and disk partition selected and registered in the required files...

- The shitty partition EFI is useless even using EFI boot. I did remove through the system(never mounted) It changes nothing :D...

- efibootmgr says no variable options

## should I use bios?!

- gotta try with a new disk...

# (I never reinstalled that much times a boot like this...)

- Excuse me but EFI is super crappy boot system, a fiasco! :D
