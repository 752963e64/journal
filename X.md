CPU doesn't bounce anormaly... top content.

grok answers very nice, CPU doesn't bounce 😸

# X

is like a sickness... you scroll endlessly... fucking media synchronization flashes all over your screen... you keep scrolling shit... it's fun to (try) determine what's true what's not... and in a split second you get a forced context switch... 

- the network hang 🙂

- you have something to do 😙

then makes you realize you spent 2 hours scrolling useless shit...

this crap space have a problem of self apreciation... it's obvious. 😙
