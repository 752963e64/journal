# writing!

## unfold

I wanna write but I must refrain myself. Keep it fold until retreiving mind quietness.

I'm harmful to myself and I understand it.

The actual estate is, I want and I don't want. This refrain me to engage in anything... This is fucking crazy experience because I feel it. It must be a braincell that drop.

I wrote something again a different way. It's hard to decide and it's super strange to have many paths that lead to same end. It is disturbing. 😙

My brain is not syncing anymore I tend to forget deliberately my capacities. I'm wondering if anything can bring me back to life.

I just got a flashback from movie I liked younger.
