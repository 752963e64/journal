Oh noz! 😸

It's hilarious to find that generally bitcoin isn't owned by the right persons 😸

The pump'n dump spiral will never end...

I remember the propaganda about the freedom decade ago... then playing with corps fund... 

It's awful, how terribly is non measurable 😸

## from now...

The reality... It cannot be anymore being assumed as an investment to play with bitcoin...

Why? This is simple... richest ppl on earth own more bitcoin than no one else...

Their transactions have consequences on the ponzi pyramid 🙂

Try to think, LIKE REALLY... trying to be smart. 😸

## When ppl will start to be smart enough when pursuing their goals...

The bitcoin is gonna fall a sad way, A SAD WAY! 😸
