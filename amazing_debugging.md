# Amazing moment awhile debugging a web page looking for crypto miner

My damn CPU is running at 50% on a static web page which is deepai... :D

Awhile profiling the thingy eating my CPU seemed to stop processing and when profiling ended, firefox were running normally without eating my damn CPU...

but when I tried to see the profile, this happened! :D
