# The network is owned by ... :D

While I wrote a script atop a linux&co shell... I discovered something strange.

When I say Linux&co, this is latest shell linux and tools. here netfilter tool.

## The script...  

I wrote this script mainly cuz I wanted to sharpen my understanding and because experiment makes you an expert.

The script were reading netfilter log in search of sentinel trying to probe my network.

Quickly I noticed that more and more sentinel were looking to probe.

I also noticed that same protocol and port often coming from the same pool were constantly showing.

## conclusion

There is some big d/baddies with resources... It's scary to see them knocking the doors such way... so primitive primal :D

It's like an assault with firearms... shout for shouting not hitting :D

# primal savagery
