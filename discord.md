I saw on X lately using discord may eat 24GB your available memory 😙

## I found a 16 yo kid that have an history for us...

The security and hacking at glance...

to shorten the story the kid is curious... he look everywhere at same time... 6 eyed minimum... 6D vision

discord has super smart tier 1000 programmers (🙂) who wanted to add complexity to their memory greedy stack...

the complexity turned to be serious 😄 as the 16yo kid stared with his 6eyed vision into the new complexity... 

It's all of that... a 16 yo kid as proof... 😸

how an unanticipated change can make you idiot and show how responsible you are really...

brief I stop here I think it's enough moral...

## for the hacking part...

I stopped long time ago to turn knobs to hack myself... It doesn't reflect the reality to someone that know computer... however it may impress lambdas from being too much trusty with what they use... 🙂
