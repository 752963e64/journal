# Strange things

I'm watching a surprisingly good programmer that run an netcat server to grab input...

He discover the netcat server end the program when closing the connection... and start scratching his head saying "I remember there is a way to keep listening"

the guy knows literaly everything about the code and seems to lack a lot of knowledge on end user capabilities some application let you enjoy.
