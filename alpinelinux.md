# AlpineLinux for the intimates

- A default managed install is not what you gonna find in this document!

- At the end of this document describing my way! you'll be able fly, literally!

## Download the toolbox

[official release x86_64](https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.23/releases/x86_64/alpine-standard-3.23.2-x86_64.iso)

## flash it on USBSTICK

```dd if=<ISO_FILEPATH> of=/dev/sdX```

wait a long moment, if your hardware is from fire era... (like me) 😸

```sync```

Obligatory toilet flush with removable devices... (psssst... many ppl lost their data like this because they didn't flush data before removing device...)

now you can remove the usb stick and plug it to the machine you wish I bless with you.

## bootstrap your machine

boot up the machine and select your pendrive as bootdevice from your bios... if it boots you are lucky...

I wont debug such problem with you...

type "root" hit return at prompt

congrats your are IN! serious shit is coming :accessibility:


# SOON®
