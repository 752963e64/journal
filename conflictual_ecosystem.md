# by surprise in middle of conflict!

Last year I was hanging on my computer and found out that graphic driver for my lovely old intel computer had vanished.

some high profile certainly from intel had literaly removed driver from mesa with none reason and with replacement something highly buggy... few day ago you could see other developers still pushing code... so it happened without even a notice in their own developer community...

What I had for replacement were unfunctional in comparison, VPU access to MPEG2 removed and replaced with opengl acceleration instead and the use of a new driver to handle the card which was crocus.

I don't know if things improved with crocus now near 2026, but what I can say is that it were not a shame for them to let struggle ppl with their damn drivers...

I managed to backport everything to the normal but when I think to the problem correctly it makes me think we putting too much trust at softwares and we shouldn't seeing how things goes...

An example with single board computer... billion are sold with the usual show around specs... but you realize too late that you are stuck with old driver bundle sometimes/all? with non free drivers... the effort made to have a fully functional board is done by random ppl advancing at snail speed... 

In short it's like the software ecosystem must stay conflictual, the drivers unfinished not fully operational/functional... so you perpetually stick after it...

This is a legal assumed scam to provide computer specs that you cannot use by yourself with the information needed to make it work or that you have to use non free drivers with a particular operating system...

Do not trust the software, do not trust the machine! It is perpetually conflictual big egos fighting...


To close this reminder: Driver made 20 years ago still not fully functional, removed... if such little reality contained in one little phrase doesn't make you mindful, I'm sorry but you are lost :D

## What a device driver!

1. A program that run, in the device! The capabilities are defined and well known by those making them.

2. A program that run in the kernel! its goal are the handling from that device and routing to the userland.

writing such driver doesn't take more time than writing a userland software...

It's alike joke when you see that no... it's not the case at all... :D

## What a software driver!

It is a program that run in the userland! Its goal are to bridge input to the driver and the features interface to the userland programs...

writing such driver may be LONG... If you performing research and development at same time... and keep putting the nice feature into closed drivers for closed Oses :D

best drivers are those following rock solid definition from what should be done!

No less, no more...
