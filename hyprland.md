# Hyprland

- I had never seen TV noise so colorful and on PC screen... 

- I had never seen a terminal window with squares drawn in place of prompt... appearently the fallback to something readable had been forgot... :D

- Didn't found a way to get an app window from another local user... xhost didn't work at this time...

- Terminal window gl drawn full of little glitches, very buggy...

- It is accelerated but full of sync/tearing problems...

- It appearently relying on a high OGL profile... You need to be a race driver with expensive recent hardware to use it decently.

## The only stuff I found cool

- The window effects

## conclusion

- Wayland is problematic
