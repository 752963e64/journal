# Hyprland

- I had never seen TV noise so colorful and on PC screen... (linked to driver/wayland/wlroots/hyprland)

- I had never seen a terminal window with squares drawn in place of prompt... appearently the fallback to something readable had been forgot... (this is not an hyprland linked problem but hyprland has his prefered terminals with font rendering issues... ) :D

- Didn't found a way to get an app window from another local user... xhost didn't work at this time... (linked to wayland toolbox)

- Terminal window gl drawn full of little glitches, very buggy... (not linked to hyprland, these program uses GPU to draw inner window.)

- It is accelerated but full of sync/tearing problems...(linked to drivers/hyprland/wlroots)

- It appearently relying on a high OGL profile... You need to be a race driver with expensive recent hardware to use it decently. (It seems a joke while it's not :D)

## The only stuff I found cool

- The window effects (without the tearing feature :D)

## conclusion

- Wayland is problematic (X11 compositors works, so it's not a problem to stick with X eleven; ELEVEN :D)
