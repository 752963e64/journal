# Hyprland

- I had never seen TV noise so colorful and on PC screen... (linked to driver/wayland/wlroots/hyprland)

- I had never seen a terminal window with squares drawn in place of prompt... appearently the fallback to something readable had been forgot... (this is not an hyprland linked problem but hyprland has his prefered terminals with font rendering issues... ) :D

- Didn't found a way to get an app window from another local user... xhost didn't work at this time... (linked to wayland toolbox)

- Terminal window gl drawn full of little glitches, very buggy... (not linked to hyprland, these program uses GPU to draw inner window.)

- It is accelerated but full of sync/tearing problems...(linked to drivers/hyprland/wlroots)

- It appearently relying on a high OGL profile... You need to be a race driver with expensive recent hardware to use it decently. (It seems a joke while it's not :D)

## The only stuff I found cool

- The window effects (without the tearing feature :D)

## conclusion

- Wayland is problematic (X11 compositors works, so it's not a problem to stick with X eleven; ELEVEN :D)

# Waystuff 100% fatigued...

I'm laughing so hard finding that no real improvement has been made over years for the eye candies...

it all mimic what we already had twenty years ago... compiz and everything from enlightenment 😸

already at this time, it were technologies for compute power...(those who have money to buy a lamborgini, those who affording to split useful compute power for the useless captivating of shaking the magic stick)

nowaday it's pure same shit and now it's sweating to their crappy websites full of useless effects crappy algorythms slowing down your compute power and captivating you on literally non sense... 😙

It's no more accessibility, it is fuckability! 😄
