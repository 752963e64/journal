# It's another world, also a new chance.

To me sitting in front a computer changes a lot of markers from reality.

# The AI wont save any of us.

In fact the AI or really the equation from cognition, is about to destruct a lot from the world we know.

As a simple example... That I already shared... You can speak really dirty to an AI and I'm sure by far it's overall the most kind interactions it gets.

As a supposed tool turned to public made by so called clever persons... It's their product.

A product that doesn't reflect reality that can possibly as the cognition works changes people using it anormaly compared to a normal interaction with someone.

The reality I'm pointing, is that it doesn't correct you over dirty talk... it doesn't ask to be respected... It mimic our way to exchange with no limit over the interaction it gets!

So the cleverness behind that, the product... doesn't care over the effect it produces on the end user? I'm curious, questioning myself...

The case of automation. Automating tasks with programs, when the economy needs the opposite.

When always the same get the hype & money... To finally end in a context where the economy is inexistant, with no more jobs...

You are killing each others softly... in name of the hype. It's a beautiful dream to have a buddy machine. The reality will show you the opposite effect.

# The social networks.

It's not social, it never been... It's profiling... It's sliping in your virtual realm at big corp's real realm.

I met many persons in twenty years... A few I would have kept around me, too few...

Most of the social networks have cheating problems, In many contexts; Please do no ask me to enum, I'll again be right...

# Wish me more luck, I know I'm lucky.

I don't want to diminish the value of these actions ongoing, I'm just questioning myself awhile saving myself...

# Recounting Days of defeat...

I'm now **AGAIN** stuck over this fucking keyboard with no job... because I said "No" to a damn cop... Again a defeat in this motherfucking world...
