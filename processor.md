# a processor

return exactly how wild does 😸

# The system loop

Is a brain metaphore 😙

The math explain everything...

# The AI

Were already here in front your eyes, since years 😸

# You are a machine

With autonomous components orchestrated from the brain powered by pulsations. No I didn't dissect any ppl. I'm Jesus Christ undercover. 😸

In the void and darkness, where nothing happens. You remain as a virgin processor powered from your own assembly.

# Ah, yes... 

not invented here **CERTAINLY** 😸
