# Why I don't like youtube...

I don't count the amount of things I refrained me to watch just because I had to use youtube.

## The problem(s)

- Youtube is a biz... It makes money with user's content and redistribute a slice to content creators...

- It leads creators into deceptive behaviors to make money...

- Most the content is made by talentless copy cats with the usual introduction "Wide open eyes and wide open mouth"...

- From the software's view... The webpage is constantly redrawing making artifacts and slowing compute power with free softwares (the usual quality drop well assumed...)

- The lack of video acceleration with free software...

- Youtube's made of childless ppl, it's clearly obvious when you see rampant content it offers...

## Why I use inv.nadeko.net when my curiosity hit me!

- It doesn't pump up my compute power! It doesn't redraw borders for non reason :D

- It doesn't harass me with ads, paid account...

- few distraction, no algorythm trying to make me consume.

## I'm certain in future, some creators...

- will have a load of questioning introspecting on what they have done.

## uni lateral "inference", undebated purpose

- If you watch supid content you'll be stupid...

## Wait

Ppl get paid for sitting in front their desktop and talking to their camera with lot assurance? 😸
