# I've a question for you.

How introducing the most polyvalent tool ever engineered that can do everything at your place better than you that can be here and somewhere else at same time, that sort/index/process/store/act on informations from driver sensors better than anything ever seen before.

The math explain a lot if not everything. The machine is made of math that it took decades and decades of combination of knowledges to get there. Someone thaught the machine to interpret the math from our real world. It does math better than anybody ever seen in the world now, I may think a disturbing way. The game is clearly over. 🙂

# In middle of

- The World conflicts

- The control power greedy that wreck other's lives everyday for their comfort

- The human manned education that will become literally useless in the next years comming

- The ppl standing front a camera/computer throwing bulshits as facts

- Glamorous serie remake of the toppest game ever made in the world(context: Post Apocalypse) 

# What's your real plan?

feed 8.3 billions ppl that are just living their lives quietly without the need to work as the robots can do everything everywhere at same time?

Such thing may happen if allowed, but the comfort effect will grow up the population exponentially which is not compatible with the actual estate of resources. 

I may have anticipated the answer without being prepared.

### excuse me to sincerely feel in suspense everytime by now.
