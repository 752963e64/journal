It's messy to run headless virtual machine, webbrowser, editor and compilation on the same host... (old intel quad core)

I remember in past I was able to configure VM to appear on the host's network...
limited in resources to split my playground and test shit... I didn't use nor recorded the way I did...

nowaday I need it cuz I have an host that can keep just the VM running...

So I'm looking a way to get a VM listening on host network... It's a fucking pain in the ASS to setup appearently :D

you have to learn about all the network type... there is more than one way to do something 😸

The hell it is to look for something that should be simple and well documented already...

I just wanna virtualize some network services that replicated to all my machines currently and it makes me think it is a shitty architecture for someone that know shit...

How hard it is to bind to phys network damn it...

# I'm near rediscovery 😸

I'm already traversing the whole slirp network directly to physical network router 😸

I hate all the fucking ways it is documented over internet... it smell an huge lack of synapses...
