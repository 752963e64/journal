# qemu

It's messy to run headless virtual machine, webbrowser, editor and compilation on the same host... (old intel quad core)

I remember in past I was able to configure VM to appear on the host's network...
limited in resources to split my playground and test shit... I didn't use nor recorded the way I did...

nowaday I need it cuz I have an host that can keep just the VM running...

So I'm looking a way to get a VM listening on host network... It's a fucking pain in the ASS to setup appearently :D

you have to learn about all the network type... there is more than one way to do something 😸
