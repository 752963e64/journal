# Strange behavior from a supposed intelligence...

Why did chatgpt sent me verification mail to end with such message when typing my fullname: ```Vladimir Poutine``` and birthdate: ```10/07/1952```

```Route Error (400 ): {
  "error": {
    "message": "The email you provided is not supported.",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "param": null,
    "code": "unsupported_email"
  }
}
```

# It's in the chat...

- no feel from real reflexion...

- It seems like looking indexes of data and printing them...

- I swear I can't have the improved chat cuz my mail box... And seeing how it does process this information it's scary :D

# Constantly soliciting...

- It's unable to put an end in the conversation. The ending statement is always the same solicitation.
