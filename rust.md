# rust

seeing the last news... It feels foreced and rejected at same time...

"Rust is here to stay..."

personally the syntax is cancer... It's my opinion

## I'm just reading few more news about rust...

[gcc is not rust or rust is not gcc](https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2025-12-15+Rust+GCC+backend%3A+Why+and+how)

I end on another technolodgy 😸...

```Cranelift is a fast, secure, relatively simple and innovative compiler backend.```

CRANELIFT what a scalp! I love the name, makes me think about my lost hairs 😸

## FIRST RUST CVE

feeling memory safe... while really these day who exploit memory?...

RCE first, memory later 😙

## I think

Rust is not linux and linux is not rust... linus allows them to fail so they can become mindful by themselves 😸

everything is modular... "staying" is a vague assumption 😙
