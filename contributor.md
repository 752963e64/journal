    community/rxvt-unicode: add patch fixing line rewrap
    
    Ref: https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/14525
```

### notice

This patch introduce a new bug...
I noticed a strange behavior with vim, it seems like when vim instanciate, the top lines get strange background that doesn't match the colorscheme.

I need hack in... but it's not really a critical problem... procrastination to the rescue 😸
