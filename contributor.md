    Ref: https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/14525
```

### notice

This patch introduce a new bug...
I noticed a strange behavior with vim, it seems like when vim instanciate the top lines get strange background that doesn't match the colorscheme.

### I determined

The patch fix something... but a strange bug appears with my own messed xterm colorscheme... it doesn't happen with the default colorscheme... but it's a bug anyways...

The bug:

When opening a text buffer with vim... some lines at top document get a different background color, This is the patch doing this... wrong terminal rendering...

I need hack in... but it's not really a critical problem... procrastination to the rescue 😸
