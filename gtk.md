# GTK

I don't understand why their configuration system is schyzo undecided 😸

WHY NOT?!

```
v2.0
config...
config...
config...
v3.0
config...
config...
config...
v4.0
...
...
...
```

But that's not an issue... any ppl understanding it with basic system programming skill can improve that...

# Ok, see ya
