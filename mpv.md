- Using simply ```mpv --window-scale=0.5 lol.mp4``` on a local file it works fucking nice...

- Using ***mpv with yt-dlp*** and ```--window-scale=0.5``` which in essence of things is strictly same shit... It doesn't fucking work...

## Really the right shake spear question is

- both reading is local, both are image bundle files... WHY it doesn't work lol :D

I don't have a PHD in weird stuffs... I'm asking myself who is in need a first aid kit? :D

## I must not look into the source

I'm gonna enforce it a sad way... :D

# damn program...
